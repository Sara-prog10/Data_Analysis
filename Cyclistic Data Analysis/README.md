Total Trip Distribution (Pie Chart): Visualizes the ratio of trips taken by customers (casual riders) versus subscribers (members), providing an overview of user segmentation and trip volume.
### 2. Trip Duration Analysis by User Type
Total Trip Time Distribution (Pie Chart): Illustrates the ratio of total trip duration between customers and subscribers, highlighting differences in ride duration patterns.
### 3. Popular Stations Mapping
Popular Stations (Map View): Displays a geographical map view highlighting popular bike stations based on trip start and end locations, aiding in station optimization and resource allocation.
### 4. Average Trip Length Comparison
Average Trip Length Comparison (Bar Chart): Compares the average trip length between customers and subscribers, allowing for a detailed analysis of user behavior and preferences.
### 5. Peak Hours of Trip Activity
Trip Take Peak Hours (Line Chart): Visualizes peak hours of bike trip activity based on user type, enabling effective management of bike fleet and operational resources.
### Filters and Interactivity
Filters: Interactive filters such as month, gender, and user type allow users to customize data views and explore specific segments of bike trip data.
## Conclusion
This bike trip data analysis dashboard in Tableau provides a comprehensive view of bike-sharing usage patterns, user behaviors, and operational insights. By leveraging visualizations and interactive features, stakeholders can make informed decisions to optimize service delivery, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive business growth.
