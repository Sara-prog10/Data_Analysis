### Attribute Information:
The dataset is anonymized so we cannot know which feature is what. There are a total of 200 features in this data set along with ID_code and target columns. The target columns contain 0 and 1 value where 0 means the customer will not do a transaction and 1 means the customer will do a transaction.

Note: You can skip EDA part in this project as feature names are not provided.

### Model Comparison Report

Create a report stating the performance of multiple models on this data and suggest the best model for production.

### Report on Challenges faced

Create a report which should include challenges you faced on data and what technique used with proper reason.

Note:-All above tasks have to be done on single jupyter notebook and share the same for final submission of project.
